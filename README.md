# 🌐 Web Development Journey 

Welcome to my **Web Development Journey**! This repository is where I document my progress as I learn and practice web development through the **Sigma Web Dev** playlist by **CodeWithHarry**. I’ll be updating this file as I master new topics and build projects, adding reflections, code snippets, and resources.

Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, or even contribute if you'd like! 🚀
