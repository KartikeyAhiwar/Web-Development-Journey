    <h2>Quantum Entanglement.</h2>
    <p><b>Quantum entanglement </b> is the phenomenon of a group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle">particles</a> being generated, interacting, or sharing spatial proximity in a manner such that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state">quantum</a> state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics">classical physics </a> and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics">quantum mechanics</a> not present in classical mechanics</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement#Quantum_mechanics">Measurements</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_properties">physical properties</a>such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector)">position</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum">momentum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)">spin</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)">polarization</a> performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox">paradoxical</a> effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse">wave function collapse</a> of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole. </p>

    <p>Such phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Podolsky">Boris Podolsky</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rosen">Nathan Rosen</a>,[2] and several papers by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a> shortly thereafter,[3][4] describing what came to be known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox">EPR paradox</a>. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_realism">local realism</a> view of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality">causality</a> (Einstein referring to it as "spooky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance">action at a distance</a>")[5] and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete. mechanics</p>

    <p>Later, however, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics were verified in tests where polarization or spin of entangled particles were measured at separate locations, statistically violating Bell's inequality.[6][7][8][9] This established that the correlations produced from quantum entanglement cannot be explained in terms of local hidden variables, i.e., properties contained within the individual particles themselves. However, despite the fact that entanglement can produce statistical correlations between events in widely separated places, it cannot be used for faster-than-light communication.[10][11][12]
    Quantum entanglement has been demonstrated experimentally with photons,[13][14] electrons,[15][16] top quarks,[17] molecules[18] and even small diamonds.[19] The use of quantum entanglement in communication and computation is an active area of research and development. </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr engaged in a long-running collegial dispute about the meaning of quantum mechanics, now known as the Bohr–Einstein debates. During these debates, Einstein introduced a thought experiment about a box that emits a photon. He noted that the experimenter's choice of what measurement to make upon the box will change what can be predicted about the photon, even if the photon is very far away. This argument, which Einstein had formulated by 1931, was an early recognition of the phenomenon that would later be called entanglement.[20] That same year, Hermann Weyl observed in his textbook on group theory and quantum mechanics that quantum systems made of multiple interacting pieces exhibit a kind of Gestalt, in which "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts".[21][22] In 1932, Erwin Schrödinger wrote down the defining equations of quantum entanglement but set them aside, unpublished.[23] In 1935, Grete Hermann studied the mathematics of an electron interacting with a photon and noted the phenomenon that would come to be called entanglement.[24] Later that same year, Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published a paper on what is now known as the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox, a thought experiment that attempted to show that "the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete".[2] Their thought experiment had two systems interact, then separate, and they showed that afterwards quantum mechanics cannot describe the two systems individually.

Shortly after this paper appeared, Erwin Schrödinger wrote a letter to Einstein in German in which he used the word Verschränkung (translated by himself as entanglement) to describe situations like that of the EPR scenario.[25] Schrödinger followed up with a full paper defining and discussing the notion of entanglement,[26] saying "I would not call [entanglement] one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought."[3] Like Einstein, Schrödinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the theory of relativity.[27] Einstein later referred to the effects of entanglement as "spukhafte Fernwirkung"[28] or "spooky action at a distance", meaning the acquisition of a value of a property at one location resulting from a measurement at a distant location.[29]

In 1946, John Archibald Wheeler suggested studying the polarization of pairs of gamma-ray photons produced by electron–positron annihilation.[30] Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov carried out this experiment in 1949,[31] thereby demonstrating that the entangled particle pairs considered by EPR could be created in the laboratory.[32]

Despite Schrödinger's claim of its importance, little work on entanglement was published for decades after his paper was published.[26] In 1964 John S. Bell demonstrated an upper limit, seen in Bell's inequality, regarding the strength of correlations that can be produced in any theory obeying local realism, and showed that quantum theory predicts violations of this limit for certain entangled systems.[33][34]: 405  His inequality is experimentally testable, and there have been numerous relevant experiments, starting with the pioneering work of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972[6] and Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982.[35][36][37]

While Bell actively discouraged students from pursuing work like his as too esoteric, after a talk at Oxford a student named Artur Ekert suggested that the violation of a Bell inequality could be used as a resource for communication.[38]: 315  Ekert followed up by publishing a quantum key distribution protocol called E91 based on it.[39][1]: 874 

In 1992, the entanglement concept was leveraged to propose quantum teleportation,[40] an effect that was realized experimentally in 1997.[41][42][43]

Beginning in the mid-1990s, Anton Zeilinger used the generation of entanglement via parametric down-conversion to develop entanglement swapping[38]: 317  and demonstrate quantum cryptography with entangled photons.[44][45]

In 2022, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger "for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science".[46]
